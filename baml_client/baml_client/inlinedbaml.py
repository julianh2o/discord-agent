GatherInformation - Use when you need to collect data or context. Available tools:\n       - FetchUrlTool: Fetch and extract web content from URLs\n       - TavilySearchTool: Search the web for information\n       - GetOllamaModelsTool: Get list of available AI models\n       - GetStoredContentTool: Retrieve stored content by SHA key\n\n    2. PerformAction - Use when you need to execute actions that modify state. Available tools (require user approval):\n       - ReadFileTool: Read contents of a file\n       - WriteFileTool: Write content to a file\n       - BashTool: Execute bash commands\n\n    3. FinalAnswer - Use when you have sufficient information to provide a complete response.\n\n    Decision Guidelines:\n    - Analyze the conversation context carefully\n    - Choose the most appropriate next step based on what's needed\n    - For GatherInformation: Only fetch information you actually need\n    - For PerformAction: Actions that require user approval (file operations, commands)\n    - For FinalAnswer: When you can confidently answer the user's question\n\n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\n\n    Conversation history:\n    {% for msg in messages %}\n    [{{ msg.role }}]: {{ msg.content }}\n    {% endfor %}\n\n    Based on the conversation context, what is the best next action?\n  \"#\n}\n",
